# Automod C++ Edition

Yes, it's here.

Your favourite asshole in a semi-working C++

Not everything is implemented and this will be updated rarely

## Advantages over the Python + GCloud version

 * It's not Python
 * It doesn't use the broken and unreliable Google Cloud
 * You can host this yourself (even on a coffeemaker)
 * It actually compiles

## Disadvantages

 * Not everyone knows C++
 * It probably doesn't compile on Windows


## Requirements

 * CMake
 * Boost
 * SSL

## How to compile

 ```
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 ```

Then use your favourite compiler or build system to get things done (Visual Studio for Windows or Makefiles for *nix)
